# Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax AI

## Project Overview

This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that includes an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm. The AI uses optimal moves to provide a challenging experience, ensuring either a win or a draw for the computer. This project demonstrates the integration of artificial intelligence algorithms in a game setting and offers an engaging way to explore AI and game development.

## Features

- **Single-Player Mode**: Play against a competitive AI opponent.
- **Unbeatable AI**: The AI is programmed to make the best moves, making it nearly unbeatable.
- **Simple, Interactive UI**: Clear game board with visual feedback for moves.
- **Game Reset**: Easily restart the game at any time.

## Key Algorithms

- **Minimax Algorithm**: Used to evaluate the game board and determine the optimal move for the AI by simulating all possible future moves.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimizes the Minimax algorithm by cutting off branches that don’t need exploration, making the AI’s decision-making faster and more efficient.

## Skills Developed

- **Game Development**: Created a complete interactive game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **AI and Algorithms**: Implemented the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for efficient game-playing logic.
- **User Interaction**: Developed an intuitive interface for smooth and responsive user experience.
